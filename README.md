# Flower-Classifier
Part of a term project, this program takes a dataset of images of flowers and matches them to the most likely type of flower from a given set of flower types using a neural network.

Flower name types for training are determined by the name of the folder the flower images are held in (i.e. a folder of dandelion images would be named dandelion).
